## Laboratory Work N1
### For plotting first laboratory work I gave two options.
### First depends on networkx, second on networkx + graphviz mix.
### Second one needs graphviz and pygraphviz pre-installed.
### Of course, all dependencies in requirements.txt must be installed.
### finite_automata.png is a visualization for my specific variant (it is created after running the script)
